**My own implementation of a Dependency Injection Container** \
_(yes, like that one we are used to using in Spring Framework)_

_To demonstrate the container's work I chose a starship area domain.\
I want to simulate the working process of a cosmodrome that manages launches of space rockets._

_The service is going to perform the next steps:_ 

`1. Notify spaceports staff that we are performing launch` \
`2. Check that area is clear and launch will be safe` \
`3. Do launch` \
`4. Notify spaceports staff about launch results`
